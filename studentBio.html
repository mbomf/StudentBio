        <h2>Here is a little bit about me</h2>
        <p>I am 21 years old, my birthday is November 25. I was born in argentina and have lived in Miami for about 16 years. 
            I love my city and enjoy photography, coding and outdoor activities and I enjoy learning about the economy, working on my economics degree, and enjoy learning about how world markets affect each other. 
            <br>
            I have a business oriented mindset and I want to apply coding to media and create amazing projects that will allow me to show the beauty of the capacity of computers. 
            I am excited to see what I can do with computers going forward, and I love to learn in an engaging and fast pace way.
        </p>
